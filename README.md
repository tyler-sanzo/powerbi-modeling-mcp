# ✨ Power BI Modeling MCP Server

The **Power BI Modeling MCP Server** implements the [MCP specification](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) to create a seamless connection between AI agents and Power BI semantic models. This project is in Public Preview and implementation may significantly change prior to our General Availability.

The **Power BI Modeling MCP Server** brings Power BI semantic modeling capabilities to your AI agents through a **local MCP server**. This allows developers and AI applications to interact with Power BI models in entirely new ways, from using natural language to execute modeling changes to autonomous AI agentic development workflows.

## 💡 What can you do?

- **🔄 Build and Modify Semantic Models with Natural Language** - Tell your AI assistant what you need, and it uses this MCP server to create, update, and manage tables, columns, measures, relationships, and more... across Power BI Desktop and Fabric semantic models.

- **⚡ Bulk Operations at Scale** - AI applications can execute batch modeling operations on hundreds of objects simultaneously — bulk renaming, bulk refactoring, model translations, or model security rules - with transaction support and error handling, turning hours of repetitive work into seconds.

- **✅ Apply modeling best practices** - Easily evaluate and implement modeling best practices against your model.

- **🤖 Agentic Development Workflows** - Supports working with [TMDL and Power BI Project files](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-bi/developer/projects/projects-dataset#tmdl-format), enabling AI agents to autonomously plan, create, and execute complex modeling tasks across your semantic model codebase.

- **🔍 Query and Validate DAX** - AI assistants can execute and validate DAX queries against your model, helping you test measures, troubleshoot calculations, and explore your data

> [!WARNING]  
> - Use caution when connecting an AI Agent to a semantic model. The underlying LLM may produce unexpected or inaccurate results, which could lead to unintended changes. **Always create a backup of your model before performing any operations.** 
> - LLMs might unintentionally expose sensitive information from the semantic model, including data or metadata, in logs or responses. **Exercise caution when sharing chat sessions.**
> - The **Power BI Modeling MCP server** can only execute modeling operations. It cannot modify other types of Power BI metadata, such as report pages or semantic model elements like diagram layouts.

### Manual install

This MCP Server can also be configured across other IDEs, CLIs, and MCP clients:

1. Download the latest version [here](../../releases/latest).
2. Unzip the contents to a folder of your choice, for example: `C:\MCPServers\PowerBIModelingMCP`
3. Run `\extension\server\powerbi-modeling-mcp.exe`
4. Copy the MCP JSON registration from the console and register it in your preferred MCP client tool.

Example of config that should work in most MCP clients:

```json
{
"servers": {
		"powerbi-modeling-mcp": {
			"type": "stdio",
			"command": "C:\\MCPServers\\PowerBIModelingMCP\\extension\\server\\powerbi-modeling-mcp.exe",
			"args": [
				"--start"                
			],
			"env": {}			
		}
	}
}
```

## 🚀 Get started

**First, you must connect to a Power BI semantic model**, which can reside in Power BI Desktop, Fabric workspace or in Power BI Project (PBIP) files.

- **For Power BI Desktop:** 

	```
	Connect to '[File Name]' in Power BI Desktop
	```

- **For Semantic Model in Fabric Workspace:**

	```
	Connect to semantic model '[Semantic Model Name]' in Fabric Workspace '[Workspace Name]'
	```
  
- **For Power BI Project files:**

	```
	Open semantic model from PBIP folder '[Path to the definition/ TMDL folder in the PBIP]'
	```

Once the connection is established, you can use natural language to ask the AI agent to make any modeling changes. To get started, try one of the following scenarios.

> [!TIP]
> The scenarios above are just examples. This MCP server equips your agents with modeling tools for any type of model change, and with the right prompt and context, you can automate virtually any modeling task.

### Confirmation prompts

This MCP Server supports the [Elicitation MCP protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/client/elicitation), requiring user approval for the following actions:

- Before the first modification made to a semantic model.
- Before the first query executed against a semantic model.

![mcp-server-elicitation](docs/img/mcp-server-elicitation.png)

> [!TIP]
> You can configure the MCP to skip these confirmations by using the `--skipconfirmation` option.

| -------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--start`            |         | Starts the MCP server; necessary for server registration with MCP client.                                                                                                                                                 |
| `--readwrite`        | Yes     | Enabled by default, enables write operations with confirmation prompt before applying an edit to your semantic model (once per database).                                                                                 |

| `--skipconfirmation` |         | Automatically approves all write operations without confirmation prompts. Only use skip confirmation mode when you're confident about the operations being performed and have appropriate backups of your semantic model. |
| `--compatibility`    | PowerBI | By default, it is optimized for Power BI semantic models. Change the setting to `Full` if you want to run this MCP server against Analysis Services databases.                                                            |

**For Visual Studio Code**, you can set the command line options configuring the `args` setting:

- We're building this in the open. Your feedback is much appreciated, and will help us shape the future of the Power BI Modeling MCP server.
    - 👉 [Open an issue](../../issues) in the public GitHub repository - we’d love to hear from you!

## Considerations and limitations

- This MCP server is only supported on the Windows platform.
- This MCP server follows the same rules and behaviors as modeling operations performed by External Tools. Refer to the [documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-bi/transform-model/desktop-external-tools#data-modeling-operations) for more information.

## Security

Your credentials are always handled securely through the official [Azure Identity SDK](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/blob/main/sdk/identity/Azure.Identity/README.md) - **we never store or manage tokens directly**.

MCP as a phenomenon is very novel and cutting-edge. As with all new technology standards, consider doing a security review to ensure any systems that integrate with MCP servers follow all regulations and standards your system is expected to adhere to. This includes not only the Power BI Modeling MCP Server, but any MCP client/agent that you choose to implement down to the model provider.

You should follow Microsoft security guidance for MCP servers, including enabling Entra ID authentication, secure token management, and network isolation. Refer to [Microsoft Security Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/api-management/secure-mcp-servers) for details.

## Permissions and Risk

MCP clients can invoke operations based on the user’s Fabric RBAC permissions. Autonomous or misconfigured clients may perform destructive actions. You should review and apply least-privilege RBAC roles and implement safeguards before deployment. Certain safeguards, such as flags to prevent destructive operations, are not standardized in the MCP specification and may not be supported by all clients.
